# algorithms


* binary search - split in halfs, and check if the number is greater or less than.
* selection sort - find the smallest (or largest) and put it in a different list.
* linked lists vs arrays - linked lists are slower for search, but faster for insert/delete than arrays.
* arrays allows fast read and are contiguous in memory.
* recursion uses the stack for functions, function calls go to the stack
* recursive functions must have a base case and a recursive case.
* stack has two operations: push and pop
